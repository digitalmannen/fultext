#Fultext 

Fultext (uglytext) is a quick way to save and share a text with others and retain ownership of your own text. 

Install fultext on your server (PHP 5.3 or later required) write the text file, formated with markdown and upload the .md file to the 'data' directory (using ftp or preferred method).

Use the link **http://yourdomain/fultext/t.php?f=filename** (exclude the .md file extension) and share your text with the world.
